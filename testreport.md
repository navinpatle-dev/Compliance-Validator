# Test Report for AI Document Compliance Checker (LangChain/Gemini Edition)

## 1. Testing Strategy

The system's functionality was validated using a combination of **unit tests** and **integration tests** executed via the `pytest` framework. This version of the report validates the application after refactoring the core AI logic to use the **LangChain** framework for orchestrating calls to the Google Gemini API.

- **Unit Tests:** The principles of unit testing were applied by testing individual API endpoint logic (e.g., handling of invalid file types, non-existent tasks).
- **Integration Tests:** The primary test case, `test_compliance_check_workflow`, covers the entire user journey, ensuring that the LangChain-powered agent correctly processes documents and returns a valid, structured report.

## 2. Test Environment

- **Framework:** Pytest `7.x`
- **HTTP Client:** HTTPX (via `TestClient` from FastAPI)
- **Execution:** Tests were run inside the Docker container to ensure the environment is identical to production.
- **Dependencies:** All dependencies were installed from the updated `requirements.txt`, which now includes `langchain` and `langchain-google-genai`.

## 3. Validation Results

### API Endpoint Tests

The API endpoints remain unchanged and continue to function as expected.

| Endpoint                     | Test Case                     | Status  | Notes                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /`                      | Root endpoint availability    | ✅ Pass | Successfully returns the welcome message, indicating it's the LangChain/Gemini Edition.           |
| `POST /check-compliance/`    | Upload valid `.docx` file     | ✅ Pass | Accepts the file, returns a `202 Accepted` status and a valid `task_id`.                          |
| `POST /check-compliance/`    | Upload invalid `.txt` file    | ✅ Pass | Correctly rejects the file with a `400 Bad Request` error.                                        |
| `GET /results/{task_id}`     | Poll for a valid task         | ✅ Pass | Successfully polls and retrieves the status of the ongoing/completed task.                        |
| `GET /results/{task_id}`     | Request a non-existent task   | ✅ Pass | Returns a `404 Not Found` error as expected.                                                      |

### AI Agent Validation (LangChain)

The agent, now using LangChain, was validated with the same set of sample documents.

| Document Type             | Expected Outcome                                                                                             | Actual Outcome                                                                                                  | Status  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Non-Compliant Document**| The report should indicate "Non-Compliant" status, a lower score, and a list of identified violations.       | The LangChain-powered agent successfully identified all expected issues. The JSON output parser correctly structured the report. | ✅ Pass |

## 4. Conclusion

The refactoring to incorporate LangChain has been successful. The core logic in `agent.py` is now significantly cleaner and more declarative. By defining chains, we separate the prompt, model, and output parser, which improves maintainability without altering the external behavior of the API. The system remains robust, functional, and meets all project requirements.
